# ðŸš€ Creative Approval API â€“ Setup Instructions

## Overview

This API validates uploaded creative files (images) against advertising
standards including the Global Outdoor Copy Approval Guidelines and ASA CAP Code
(UK). The service performs automated checks to determine if content should be
approved, rejected, or requires manual review.

You can run it locally or via Docker.

### Validation Logic

The system categorizes content into three outcomes:

-   **APPROVED**: Content meets all guidelines and can be used.
-   **REJECTED**: Content contains prohibited elements and cannot be used.
-   **REQUIRES_REVIEW**: Content contains restricted elements requiring manual
    review.

### Implemented Checks

1. **File Format & Technical Validation**

    - Supports PNG, JPEG, and small GIF files
    - Validates dimensions, file size, and aspect ratios
    - Checks for low contrast or accessibility issues
    - Flags flashing GIFs or high frame rates for review

2. **Content Filtering**

    - Filename and metadata analysis:
        - Prohibited terms detection (tobacco, weapons, explicit content, etc.)
        - Restricted terms detection (crypto, gambling, etc.)
        - Age restricted terms (alcohol, energy drink, etc.)

3. **Context-Aware Validation**
    - Location-based restrictions (e.g., alcohol near schools)
    - Market-specific content restrictions
    - Audience-appropriate content validation

The validation logic interprets prohibited content (directly rejected) versus
restricted content (requires review) based on established advertising
guidelines.

## 1. Local Development Setup

### Prerequisites

-   Python **3.11+**
-   pip or Poetry for dependency management

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/georgemarsh1809/GlobalTask.git
cd GlobalTask
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # Mac/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the API locally:

```bash
uvicorn src.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

5. Open the interactive API docs in your browser: ðŸ‘‰ http://localhost:8000/docs

## 2. Run with Docker

### Prerequisites

-   Docker installed and running

### Steps

1. Build the image:

```bash
docker build -t creative-approval-api .
```

2. Run the container:

```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 creative-approval-api
```

3. Open the interactive API docs: ðŸ‘‰ http://localhost:8000/docs

## 3. Run Tests

The project uses **pytest** with tiny test images generated at runtime.

Locally:

```bash
pytest -v
```

In Docker:

```bash
docker run creative-approval-api pytest -v
```

You can also test the API with an API platform like Postman. This will allow you
to upload real images and a metadata string. \

â†’ **Note that there is an error handler for forbidden metadata keys. Any
unexpected keys will throw a 422 response.**

## 4. API Endpoints

-   `GET /health` â†’ Service status
-   `POST /creative-approval` â†’ Upload a creative for validation
    -   **Input**: multipart form with:
        -   `file`: PNG/JPEG/small GIF
        -   `metadata`: optional JSON string (`market`, `placement`, `audience`,
            `category`)
    -   **Output**: JSON with:
        -   `status`: `"APPROVED"`, `"REJECTED"`, `"REQUIRES_REVIEW"`
        -   `reasons`: list of reasons if status is `"REJECTED"` or
            `"REQUIRES_REVIEW"`
        -   `img_format`, `img_width`, `img_height`, `img_size`

## 5. My Approach

1. Built a FastAPI server with two required endpoints.
2. Created a Dockerfile to containerize the service on port 8000.
3. Reviewed policies to determine prohibited vs restricted checks.
4. Implemented backend services for each check.
5. Linked outcomes directly to policy interpretation.

Considering the 3 possible outcomes, it was important to interpret the
difference between prohibited and restricted creative content from the 2
policies. These forms of content can be directly mapped to an outcome:

-   Prohibited content (not allowed) â†’ REJECTED
-   Restricted content (advice needed) â†’ REQUIRES_REVIEW If the creative content
    contains copy that is determined neither prohibited nor restricted, the
    creative is suitable for approval.

### High-Level Outcome Mapping:

Prohibited â†’ REJECTED

Restricted â†’ REQUIRES_REVIEW

Otherwise â†’ APPROVED

This direct mapping speeds up policy interpretation and keeps the scope
lightweight, as required in the brief.

### Implemented Checks + Policy References

1. **File Format / Size / Dimensions / Aspect Ratio / Contrast / File
   Complexity**

-   Reject unsupported formats (non-JPEG/PNG/GIF), as defined in brief.
-   Low contrast or tiny dimensions â†’ REQUIRES_REVIEW.
    -   Justified by:
        -   Global Guidelines (require ads not to disorient or confuse the
            public, and to meet accessibility expectations).
        -   CAP Code Section 4.7 (visual effects harmful to certain groups).
        -   CAP Code Section 1.3 (responsibility to consumers, including clear,
            readable messaging).
-   Flashing GIFs or very high frame rates â†’ flag for review.
    -   Justified by:
        -   Global Outdoor Copy Approval Guidelines â†’ explicitly bans fast
            flashing/disorientating visuals.
        -   ASA CAP Code â†’ bans harmful visual effects (Section 4.7).

2. **Prohibited & Restricted Keyword Filtering of Filenames and Metadata**

-   Filter against prohibited terms (tobacco, casino, porn, weapon, etc.) and
    restricted terms (crypto, gambling, alcohol, etc.).

    -   Global Guidelines define prohibited/restricted categories.
    -   ASA CAP Code defines specific prohibited/restricted themes:
        -   **Tobacco** (Section 21) - full restriction.
        -   **Alcohol** (Section 18) - restrictions on portrayal and placement.
            If audience is under 18, then creative prohibited (18.14).
        -   **Medicines, health, beauty** (Section 12) - restricts
            health/medical claims, requires review and substantiation (12.1).
        -   **Electronic cigarettes** (Section 22) - If audience is under 18,
            then creative prohibited (22.11)
        -   **Environmental claims** (Section 11) - requires review and
            substantiation (11.3).
        -   **Weight control / slimming** (Section 13) â†’ avoids exploitative or
            misleading slimming claims, requires review and substantiation. If
            audience is under 18, then creative prohibited (13.3)
        -   **Gambling** (Section 16) â†’ restricted category. If audience is
            under 18, then creative prohibited (16.3.13).
        -   **Food, supplements & nutrition** (Section 15) â†’ Restrictions on ads
            related to HFSS food (high fat, sugar, salt) issues, requires review
            and substantiation (15.1).

    These themes were parsed to ChatGPT to create a list of terms that are
    stored in an array in terms.py, which filenames and metadata is checked
    against.

3. **Metadata-based checks** (if parsed)

-   e.g.
    -   If `placement=school` and creative mentions age restricted themes
        (alcohol/gambling) â†’ REJECT.
    -   If market is in banned countries list â†’ REQUIRES_REVIEW.
-   Meta-data properties include:
    -   Placement
    -   Audience
    -   Market (country)
    -   Category (any themes listed in the policy interpretations (e.g. alcohol,
        tobacco, crypto)
